It allows to convert between those formats, to\n * edit the underlying transaction, to build it, to sign it and to send it to\n * the blockchain.\n *\n * There are 3 main formats from which the other are derived:\n *\n * * The StellarSdk [Transaction]{@link {@link https://stellar.github.io/js-stellar-sdk/Transaction.html}} object. (**transaction**)\n * * The CosmicLink, which is a transaction encoded as a query. (**query**)\n * * The Tdesc, which is an internal JSON-compatible format in-between those two.\n *   It is the easier format to work with. (**tdesc**)\n *\n * Those formats can be derived into other related formats:\n *\n * * The XDR, which's a base64 representation of StellarSdk Transaction. (**xdr**)\n * * The Sep-0007 link, in its XDR form. (**sep7**)\n * * The CosmicLink URL/URI, which is a page plus the query. (**uri**)\n * * The Tdesc JSON, which is its stringified version. (**json**)\n *\n * A CosmicLink object can be created from any of those formats. Some of the\n * other formats are immediately available, while others may need an\n * `await cosmicLink.lock()` operation to become computable:\n *\n * * If you create a CosmicLink from an **uri**, a **query**, a **tdesc** or a\n *   **json**, only those 4 formats are available at first. Transaction, xdr &\n *   sep7 will become available after a `cosmicLink.lock()`. (**free formats**)\n * * If you create a CosmicLink from a **transaction**, an **xdr** or a **sep7**,\n *   all formats will immediately be available. (**locked formats**)\n *\n * For a better efficiency, formats are lazy-evaluated. This means that they are\n * computed once only if/when you call them:\n *\n * ```js\n * const cosmicLink = new CosmicLink(xdr, { network: 'test' })\n * console.log(cosmicLink.query)\n * ```\n *\n * The role of `cosmicLink.lock()` is centric to this class. In practice, the\n * free formats don't have to be tied to a **network**, a **source** or a\n * **sequence number**. For example, the CosmicQuery `?inflation` is a valid\n * generic transaction that can be locked to any network/source/sequence\n * combination.\n *\n * On the other hand, locked formats are always tied to a particular combination\n * of those, hence the need for a **lock** command:\n *\n * ```js\n * const cosmicLib = require('cosmic-lib')\n * cosmicLib.network = 'test'\n * cosmicLib.source = 'tips*cosmic.link'\n *\n * const cosmicLink = new cosmicLib.CosmicLink('?inflation')\n *\n * console.log(cosmicLink.tdesc.source)    // => undefined\n * console.log(cosmicLink.tdesc.network)   // => undefined\n * console.log(cosmicLink.tdesc.sequence)  // => undefined\n * console.log(cosmicLink.xdr)             // => undefined\n *\n * await cosmicLink.lock({)\n *\n * console.log(cosmicLink.tdesc.source)    // => 'GC6Z...2JVW'\n * console.log(cosmicLink.tdesc.network)   // => 'test'\n * console.log(cosmicLink.tdesc.sequence)  // => 29...3903\n * console.log(cosmicLink.xdr)             // => 'AAAA....AA=='\n * ```\n *\n * The **lock** command is asynchronous because free formats accept\n * [federated addresses]{@link https://stellar.org/developers/guides/concepts/federation.html},\n * but locked formats don't. The library automatically resolve\n * those and this is an asynchronous operation. At the same time, it downloads\n * the required data from the blockchain to handle multi-signers transactions.\n *\n * After the lock operation, all free formats are updated according to the new\n * state of the transaction. It is now possible to `cosmicLink.sign(keypair)`\n * it, and to `cosmicLink.send()` it to the blockchain.\n */\n\n\nclass CosmicLink {\n  /**\n   * Create a new CosmicLink object. **transaction** can be one of the accepted\n   * format: uri, query, json, tdesc, transaction, xdr or sep7.\n   *\n   * @constructor\n   * @param {string|Object|Transaction} transaction A transaction in one of\n   *  thoses formats: uri, query, json, tdesc, transaction, xdr, sep7\n   * @param {Object} options Additional options\n   * @param {string} options.page The base URI to use when converting transaction\n   *     to URI format.\n   * @param {string} options.network For Transaction/XDR formats, the network for\n   *     which it have been created\n   * @param {string} options.strip Remove an element from the original\n   *     XDR transaction.
